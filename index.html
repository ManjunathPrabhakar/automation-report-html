                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
                        Contributor hereby grants to
                        You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
                        license to reproduce, prepare
                        Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and

                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each

                        this section) patent
                        license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license
                        applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
                        infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
                        Contribution(s) was
                        submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
                        counterclaim in a lawsuit)
                        alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
                        contributory patent
                        infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
                        terminate as of the date
                        such litigation is filed.

                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
                        thereof in any medium, with
                        or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
                        conditions:

                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files;
                        and
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright,
                        patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the
                        Derivative Works; and
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute
                        must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
                        excluding those notices that
                        do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
                        within a NOTICE text file
                        distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
                        provided along with the
                        Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
                        third-party notices
                        normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
                        modify the License. You
                        may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or
                        as an addendum to the
                        NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the
                        License.

                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
                        different license terms and
                        conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
                        Derivative Works as a whole,
                        provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the
                        conditions stated in this
                        License.
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
                        intentionally submitted for
                        inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
                        License, without any
                        additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
                        modify the terms of any
                        separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
                        service marks, or product
                        names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and
                        reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
                        provides the Work (and
                        each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
                        CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
                        express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
                        NON-INFRINGEMENT,
                        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
                        the appropriateness of
                        using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
                        permissions under this License.

                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
                        negligence), contract, or
                        otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
                        agreed to in writing,
                        shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or
                        consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
                        inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
                        or malfunction, or any
                        and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
                        possibility of such
                        damages.

                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
                        thereof, You may choose
                        to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
                        obligations and/or rights
                        consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
                        own behalf and on Your
                        sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each
                        Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
                        by reason of your
                        accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
